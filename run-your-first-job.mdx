title: Running your first job
description: '_IonQ’s quantum computers process jobs sent to them via our API, however, most users leverage an SDK to submit their jobs to simplify the process. This guide covers the basics of writing and then running your first quantum program using Qiskit, a commonly-used SDK within our community. For guides to other SDKs, look in our [GitHub example repo](https://github.com/ionq-samples/getting-started)._'

## What is Qiskit

[Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit) is an open source Python SDK for working with quantum computers at a variety 
of levels—from the “metal” itself, to pulses, gates, circuits and higher-order application areas like quantum machine 
learning and quantum chemistry. It has “Providers” that enable support for different vendors and the various “backends” 
(read: quantum computers or simulators) that they offer. 

IonQ maintains an [IonQ Provider for Qiskit]() that allows you to work with our trapped-ion systems and our high-performance 
cloud simulator, which we’ll install and use here.

## Before you get started
You’ll need an account on the [IonQ Quantum Cloud](https://cloud.ionq.com), and you’ll need to create an API key. We 
also have a guide about [setting up and managing your API keys]() if you need some help.

You’ll also need Python 3.11 running locally on your machine. Run `python --version` from your command line if you need to check.

---

## Setting up Qiskit

First, we’ll install Qiskit and the IonQ Provider from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) using pip:

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-ionq
```

Note: We encourage doing this inside an environment management system like 
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) so as to avoid 
[this fate](https://xkcd.com/1987/), but do what makes the most sense for you.

## Set up your environment

By default, Qiskit will look in your local environment for a variable named IONQ_API_KEY, so if that is set, it will 
find it automatically there. From your command line, run:

```bash
export IONQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

_Note: If you’d prefer, you can also pass your key as an argument to the IonQProvider object directly._

## Start a script

For this exercise, we’ll create a Python file and run it as a script. If you’re comfortable and familiar with Python, 
you can approach this any number of ways—our ionq-examples project includes a number of Jupyter notebooks and other 
approaches to check out.

Open your a file up in whatever IDE you prefer, and add the following:

```python
from qiskit_ionq import IonQProvider
provider = IonQProvider()

print(provider.backends())
```

It should print the results below—something like this:

```bash
[<IonQSimulatorBackend('ionq_simulator')>, <IonQQPUBackend('ionq_qpu')>]
```

If this works correctly then your Qiskit installation works, your API token is valid, and you have access to the IonQ 
simulator! If you had access to a QPU, you’d see it in this list, as well.

## Submitting a Circuit

Now that we have a working Qiskit environment, let’s try running a simple Bell state. Try running this script:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_ionq import IonQProvider

provider = IonQProvider()
simulator_backend = provider.get_backend("simulator")

# Create a basic Bell State circuit:
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

# Run the circuit on IonQ's platform:
job = simulator_backend.run(qc, shots=10000) 

# Print the counts
print(job.get_counts())
```

When you run it, you should see something like:

```bash
{'00': 4984, '11': 5016}
```

The simulator is simulating the circuit we defined, running it 10,000 times, and counting each state that it evaluated 
to. In this case, it evaluated to a “00” state 5,025 times, and in a “11” state 4,975 times.

The simulator provides the “ideal” probabilities from the circuit, and the provider creates “counts” by randomly 
sampling from these probabilities. The raw (“true”) probabilities are also accessible by calling a function, like so:

```python
print(job.get_probabilities())
```

Which should return something like:

```python
{'00': 0.5, '11': 0.5}
```

All of your jobs, regardless of backend or status, can be viewed on the [“My Jobs” tab](https://cloud.ionq.com/jobs) 
on the Cloud Console, or retrieved [via API](/api-reference/jobs).
